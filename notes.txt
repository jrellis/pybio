TODO:
Multiple alignment - Clustal Omega, Muscle
Pairwise alignment against a file.
Installed libraries
Reverse transcription
Clustal file format
Refactor from_fasta, from_fastq - have the files return by matching an identifier
improve match output

Work on SSW usefulness

1. Improve alignment output
    confusion about target/query *
    allow printing a part of the match
    divide the lines, blast style
    closer to blast style
    best for whole genome?
2. Check use cases for ssw/blast, and extend to these; compare to blast results.
    seq/seq
    seq/library
    organism/library
3. Get as many of these use cases into ssw. Compare results to pybio.
4. Also compare results, output, and speed with BLAST
5. score filter

Bring up to Competitors - small algorithms
    Reverse transcription?

Multiple Alignment (Clustal Omega, Muscle?)

BLAST (blastn, blastp,...)

SSW to processor parallel

Refactor of ssw code
    Processor level parallelism at C level
